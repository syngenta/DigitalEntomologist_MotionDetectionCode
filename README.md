## Introduction

### What is the Biodiversity Sensor Project?

The Biodiversity Sensor is a system for the reliable, autonomous, low-cost collection and sharing of biodiversity data. The system will be low-cost, solar-powered, using machine-learning algorithms to identify and quantify moving species automatically, autonomously, reliably and at scale. Data will be shared in leading biodiversity platforms with farmers, scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders.

Syngenta Group, along with its partners IIT Ropar and Fraunhofer IME, is using its digital and biology expertise to spearhead the Biodiversity Sensor Project. The initial phase of the project will focus on identifying and quantifying moving species in and around farms to better track and measure the population that contributes to a healthy agriculture biosphere.

The project is currently in the R&D stage. In 2022, lab and semi-field testing were done successfully. In 2023, prototypes are being tested for on-field use cases.
